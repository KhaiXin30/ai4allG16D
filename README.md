# CyberAttack Financial Loss Predictor 

Developed a neural network model to predict the financial loss ($M) of cyberattacks using kaggle datasets from 2015–2024. Learned to employ ython techniques and data analysis methodologies all within AI4ALL's cutting-edge AI4ALL Ignite accelerator.


## Problem Statement <!--- do not change this line -->

*Cyberattacks are increasing in scale, frequency, and cost. Yet, few tools help organizations predict how much they stand to lose *before* the damage. By modeling historical breach data, we aim to provide a data-driven loss estimation tool, helping cybersecurity teams assess risk and allocate defense budgets more effectively*


## Key Results <!--- do not change this line -->

1. *Cleaned a dataset of global cyberattacks.*
2. *Trained a neural network on key variables (industry, attack type, breach type, affected users) to predict financial loss.*
3. *Achieved an MAE (Mean Absolute Error) of $X.XM on test data after applying log-transform scaling.*
4. *Discovered strong correlations between “Density” and Financial Loss.*


## Methodologies <!--- do not change this line -->

(UPDATE IN README.md)

*EXAMPLE:*
*Here’s your content rewritten in the sentence format like the example: To build an effective predictive model, we first loaded and cleaned the dataset using pandas, handling null values, encoding categorical variables, and applying a log transformation to the target.*

*To accomplish this, we utilized the OpenAI API to interact with ChatGPT, and we designed a custom Python script to generate diverse prompts and collect corresponding responses. The data was then processed and analyzed using pandas, enabling us to detect patterns and biases in the AI model's outputs.*
*Engineered a Python script to generate over 1,000 prompts and elicit their responses from ChatGPT, utilizing pandas to collect the data. When prompted for solutions to this specific relevant crisis, nearly 80% of ChatGPT's responses promoted a certain worldview.*
